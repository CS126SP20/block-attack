# CS 126 Final Project
* For my final project, I decided to create an implementation of Not Tetris
* Within this project I utilized the Box2D Cinder Block, Cinder audio, and OpenGl

#Rules
* In this game single blocks of different shapes will fall down with a forces of physics applied upon them.
* By utilizing the arrow keys you are able to move the blocks: 
    * Up Key: Rotate the block clockwise
    * Down Key: Rotate the block counter-clockwise
    * Right Key: Move the block to the right
    * Left Key: move the block to the left

#How to run Block Attack
* To run this game you must have an IDE such as Xcode, Clion, or any other suitable IDE.
* You must also have cinder downloaded and available to use.
* Once set up with both cinder and your IDE, download the zip and extract it.
* After extracting, create a folder and place this folder in there.
* Click the green arrow (or whichever button is run) and enjoy the game!
